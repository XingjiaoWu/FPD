## Overview
FPD is the first manually annotated dataset that focuses on fine-grained segmentation, which consists of 66 non-Manhattan layout documents (shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:fpd}). In the labeling process, we use point labeling and polygon labeling, and the label export style is ``cvat for images 1.1". The data comes from the pages of complex Chinese and English magazines, and the page size is not fixed.
